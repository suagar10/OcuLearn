## Description
We aim to create **OcuLearn**, a futuristic learning and presentation tool, that allows your presentation to come into real time space for the viewers.
With the world shifted to **online mode**, lectures have become boring and capturing the student's attention is difficult. We believe Augmented Reality is one way we can seize the attention by enhancing their learning experience and bringing back their lost trust in our education system.

OcuLearn provides you with a platform to visualize and manipulate any objects in your presentation as 3D models in the real-time space using _gestures_ which will help the students to easily understand different aspects of a concept. Now the speaker can bring in the 3D figures on live camera and engage students with a much more captivating presentation so that education doesn't have to compromise due to coronovirus!

## Approach
We have created some 3D models that explain concepts in different subjects and these models will be projected onto the presentation. The 3D models can be easily controlled by hand gestures for panning, zooming and rotating.
